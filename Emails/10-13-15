Hello,

Thanks to those who came and congratulations to everyone for creating their own website! For those who didn't come, we went through this tutorial: https://github.com/hackedu/hackedu/blob/master/playbook/workshops/portfolio/README.md. Here is my spinoff : http://jsbin.com/kuwiniruza/1/edit?html,css,js,console,output

Next week, we'll all be learning about DNS from one of our officers, Nick!!!!!!!! You'll learn how a website gets displayed in your browser. Also, if we have a little bit more time, we'll get started on a 3 week project of recreating Pong in javascript (with HTML/CSS).

Oh yeah, if you complete codecademy's HTML/CSS course and/or Javascript course, I'll give you a cookie. Also, if you get more than 20 karma on codewars, I'll give you a cookie.

Cheers,
Ethan Chiu
