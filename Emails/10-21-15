Hey everyone,

I hope everyone is doing well! I got contacted by one of the organizers from PennApps, a collegiate hackathon at UPenn. She really wanted to have more high schoolers come to PennApps this year. So, she wanted me to email you guys to apply. PennApps this year will have a mentoring system where beginning hackers will get the opportunity to create an application with a more experienced hacker. 

In terms of the application, it is made to see how passionate attendees are for PennApps. So, regardless of experience, you all should definitely apply. A lot of attendees last year at PennApps were beginners in programming. 

Apply here: http://2016s.pennapps.com/

This is a great opportunity to learn and to create something awesome with code! Hope you guys apply!

Cheers,
Ethan Chiu
