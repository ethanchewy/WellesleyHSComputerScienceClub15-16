Hello again,

For those who couldn't make it, hopefully you can join us for our next meeting (9/29) in room 452! Notes will be posted in the google drive folder soon. 

For the next meeting, we will be going over how to create a basic site using just markup languages HTML/CSS and how to use git/github.

As always, feel free to email me if you have any questions or concerns. 

Cheers,
Ethan Chiu

PS: I have uploaded my presentation on git/github in the google drive folder if you'd like to take a look.
