Hello Everyone,

There will be a CS Meeting afterschool in room 452. We will start creating Pong! Also, this meeting will mostly be unstructured, meaning that people can explore through different competitions. Oh yeah, and for those who have done CodeWars or codecademy or some sort of coding outside of school, I'll give you a cookie. 

I have updated the github repository so that there is more information ahead of time for each meeting. Take a look: https://github.com/ethanchewy/WellesleyHSComputerScienceClub15-16

As always, if you have any questions, message me. 

Cheers,
Ethan Chiu
