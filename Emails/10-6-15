Hello Everyone,

Today there will be a meeting in room 452. You will all learn how to deploy your first website. 

Please bring your computer and download the following programs:
https://desktop.github.com/
https://git-scm.com/downloads 
http://www.sublimetext.com/ (or any text editor you'd like to code with)
Also, please sign up for github (https://github.com/). 

For people who are more experienced/advanced with programming, we will be competing/practicing for the NYU forensics competition. 

Cheers,
Ethan Chiu
