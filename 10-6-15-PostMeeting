Hello, 

For those who came, thanks for coming (and welcome to the new members :))! I hope you enjoyed creating your first website on github. Its definitely confusing at first. To clarify, I know there are much easier ways for deploying a website than the method I showed you through github but I find learning it through github to be the most powerful. If you continue programming, learning github and git gives you a head start because many companies/developers use github for sharing and collaboration. 

Here are a list of resources that will hopefully clarify I few things:
Step by step tutorial from my friend (very easy to visualize):

More resources for those who want to get ahead!!!!!!!!!
Codecademy (interactive)

Events y'all should go to because hackathons are awesome!!!!!!!! (I honestly learned so much from hackathon mentors and my teammates.):
Blueprint

CodeDay
https://codeday.org/
HackDartmouth (for more advanced programmers)

In general, we will be working on lots of mini projects throughout the year. Hopefully by the end of November, we will all be comfortable with HTML/CSS and Javascript. 

That being said, I strongly recommend learning by doing so that's why I envision a project based club. Actually making a project and executing it will help you learn from mistakes and strengthen your programming skills. Also, learning programming is difficult so don't give up if you run into an issue that takes you a while to solve. I honestly spent 8 hours learning to deploy a web application through git and github because I was trying to learn it all by myself. Always reach out to forums (stackoverflow, facebook groups like hackathon hackers, quora, etc.) or people with experience in programming. 

For those who are more experienced in programming, I strongly advise you guys to challenge yourself on these platforms:
HackerRank
https://www.hackerrank.com/
USACO
http://www.usaco.org/
CodeWars
http://www.codewars.com/
For those gamers out there
https://codecombat.com/
Also, if you're more interested in cybersecurity, message me on facebook and I can send you much more information. 

Thanks for reading all this. I know today wasn't the most organized meeting ever. So, I'd like to personally hear your feedback: https://wellesleyhacks.typeform.com/to/Dxs0K0 . If you fill this out, I'll give you a cookie.

As always, email or facebook message me if you have any issues programming. I'm here to help! And don't forget to invite your friends to CS club!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Cheers,
Ethan Chiu
